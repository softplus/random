Basic touch 1-key USB keyboard. About as magical as cheese.

Tested on Sparkfun Pro Micro (ATmega 32u4). I use a clone from Aliexpress: https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=%22pro+micro%22
Probably works on all of the similar devices. 

Triggers Ctrl-1 as a USB keyboard. Your app can catch Ctrl-1 as whatever (I use it as a global mute/unmute for Hangouts)

Sample hardware implementation:
![SpoonKey](SimpleTouchSpoon.png?raw=true "SpoonKey")
(Using a paperclip + spoon as a touch surface)
