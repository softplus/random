# simple 1-key USB keyboard using an attiny85 mcu

Based on Digistump's Digispark attiny85 design & firmware. Runs Arduino code. 

Kinda flakey USB connection, probably because the attiny85 doesn't have a real clock. Firmware uses V-USB. 

Arduino sketch is super-basic.

Board is designed for mechanical keyswitches (MX Cherry).
